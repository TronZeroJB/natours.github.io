This website uses live server for testing and starting, install it using - **npm i -g live-server**
followed by **npm i**

if you get errors on **npm i**, remove version names from **devDependencies** and add an asterisk(*) = "abc": "^x.x.x" to "abc": "\*"


**npm start or npm run devserver**

This website was made while I was finishing the SASS/SCSS course from Jonas Schmedtmann, while I have coded, debugged and made the design credit goes to him.
